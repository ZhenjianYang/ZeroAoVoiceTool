ZeroAoVoiceTool
===============

A tool which can add scene voice for the PC games *The Legend of Heroes:
Zero no Kiseki* & *The Legend of Heroes: Ao no Kiseki*

**NOTE:**This projcet is licensed under the GPLv3. You MUST copy,
distribute and/or modify any code or binaries from this projcet under
this license. See LICENSE for details

**NOTE:**Do NOT upload any offical resources (The entire game or game
resources like voice files, Chinese or Japesene texts, scena files,
etc.) or anything modified from them.

To let it work, you need three things done before:

-   first, you need to extact the voice files(\*.at9) from the PS Vita
    games *Zero no Kiseki Evolution* & *Ao no Kiseki Evolution* (no
    mater they are card or downloaded games) and convert them to
    wave files(\*.wav).

-   Second, you need to make voice table files for each scena file(a
    scena file means a file under the folder "scena").This project also
    provide tools to make voice table files -- if you can get the
    decrypted scena files of the PC version games and the original scena
    files of the PS Vita version games -- and two sets of voice table
    files, one for *Zero no Kiseki* and the other for *Ao no kiseki*.

-   Third, get a legal copy of the game

By now, this tool can only work for:

-   *The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki* , Chinese Simplified version,
    version 1.1 (version 1.1 has 1000 save slots but version 1.0 has
    only 100)

-   *The Legend of Heroes: Ao no Kiseki*, Chinese Simplified version,
    version 1.0
